# Security-Dashboard #
A dashboard that shows the status of security features on .gov.it websites

Check out the [Live Demo](https://security-dashboard.herokuapp.com).

Usage
----


Install on local
-----

If you prefer to run it directly on your local machine, I suggest using
[virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) (maybe have a look at
[virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)),
anyway here the commands you have to enter:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Then:

    python app.py

## To Do

The add and update methods related to apis haven't been included, otherwise the current API is fully implemented (at least as of June 2017).
